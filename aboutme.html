        <h2>Favorite Book: Ready Player One</h2>
        <p>
            Ready Player One is my favorite book because it takes all the things I am into
            <br>
            like video games, music, and movies and tells a very interesting adventure story.
            <br>
            It is about a VR world that people go to in the future to instead of being in the
            <br>
            real world. It references real games like 'joust' and movies like the 'Ghostbusters'.
            <br>
            So it was a treat to keep reading and seeing all the references I could get.
