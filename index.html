        <h2>Favorite Team Sport: Football</h2>
        <p>I like the sport of Football because it is very <b>entertaining</b> to watch
            and I like how <b>passionate</b> people are about their favorite teams it is in the United States.
            <br>
            Seeing a touchdown from your favorite team is a great feeling. Looking at the speed of some players is crazy.
            My favorite thing about the sport is that I am a Kansas City Chiefs fan and we are in the super bowl this year.
